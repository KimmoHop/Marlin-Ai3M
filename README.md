# Anycubic i3 Mega / Mega-S Marlin 1.1.9 by davidramiro adapted to RepRapDiscount full graphics display

Forked from [Anycubic i3 Mega / Mega-S Marlin 1.1.9 by davidramiro](https://github.com/davidramiro/Marlin-Ai3M)

## Changes

- Anycubic TFT display disabled
- RepRapDiscoun full graphics enabled
- SPI delay adjusted for clone with long cables
- Serial buffers adjusted for lesser memory usage
- M73 R support, displayed instead of X and Y cordinates
- Manual level corners (moves from corner to corner)

## Still works

- Filament sensor
- Manual mesh bed levelling, but a lot easier with "standard" display

## Bugs

- Still no power out resume

## Connection

See [connection board image](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/5f/ee/44/74/92/IMG_5204.JPG) posted by [General5X](https://www.thingiverse.com/Generalx5)

See [Trigorilla connections](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/6f/1b/cd/c5/98/trigorilla.png) posted by [misterbig](https://www.thingiverse.com/misterbig)

RepRap display J2 goes to Trigorilla EXP1

RepRap display J3 goes to Trigorilla EXP2

Connection board connector HUB is connected (it seems to be 2mm raster, I didn't have dupont wires for that :/ )

Connection board pins PIN_19 .. PIN_3 are wired to Trigorilla limit switches D19 .. D3

Connection board pins PIN_GROUND and PIN_A13 are wired to Trigorilla Temp sensors GDN and A13 (nozzle temp sensor)


Make sure not to take out connectors in A14 and AUX. Some are hot glued to connection board.

After that build Marlin, update firmware with Marlin.ino.mega.hex (never the one with bootloader!) and see if it works ;)


## Changes by [davidramiro](https://github.com/davidramiro):

- Thermal runaway protection thresholds tweaked
- Manual mesh bed leveling enabled ([check this link](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/wiki/Manual-Mesh-Bed-Leveling) to learn more about it)
- Heatbed PID mode enabled
- TMC2208 configured in standalone mode
- Stepper orientation flipped (you don't have to flip the connectors on the board anymore)
- Linear advance unlocked (Off by default. [Research, calibrate](http://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html) and then enable with `M900 Kx`)
- S-Curve Acceleration enabled
- G26 Mesh Validation enabled
- Some redundant code removed to save memory
- Minor tweaks on default jerk and acceleration
- Print statistics enabled (send `M78` to read them)
- `M600` filament change feature enabled
  - Implemented easy resume via display
- Filament runout behaviour tweaked
  - Added purge and retract
  - Move nozzle to park position on runout
  - Prevent false positives by adding a small delay to the sensor
- Pause and stop behaviour tweaked
- Added `M888` cooldown routine for the Anycubic Ultrabase


## Changes by [derhopp](https://github.com/derhopp/):

- 12V capability on FAN0 (parts cooling fan) enabled
- Buzzer disabled (e.g. startup beep)
- Subdirectory support: Press the round arrow after selecting a directory
- Special menu in the SD file menu: Press the round arrow after selecting `Special menu`


## About Marlin

<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

Marlin is an optimized firmware for [RepRap 3D printers](http://reprap.org/) based on the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform. First created in 2011 for RepRap and Ultimaker printers, today Marlin drives a majority of the world's most popular 3D printers. Marlin delivers outstanding print quality with unprecedented control over the process.
